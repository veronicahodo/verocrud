Changelog for VeroCrud

Version:
---------
    0.5.0: Unfucked up where I was passing an array of objects to 
            build the sql update/insert strings when a simple object
            would work.
    0.4.0: Basic build. Everything works, just waiting to
            use it in some real world scenarios before
            giving it 1.0 status
